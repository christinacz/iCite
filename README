iCite is a lightweight package written in Python to 
query the INSPIRE HEP database to get citation 
statistics and h-Index of an author or collaboration. 
It then analyzes the result for comparison with other 
authors or groups. It also stores the result locally 
in a text file for further analysis.

The main executable is 'analyzer.py', which can be run 
on command-line in a terminal window using the command 

python analyzer.py

It will produce a bunch of plots comparing h-Indices and 
citations of several large collaborations in the filed 
of High Energy Physics, Particle Astro-physics, and 
Cosmology. You can modify input definitions in 'globals.py' 
according to your needs to make your own comparison plots. 
You can either run a brand-new query (which is the default) 
or analyze data stored in a text file from a previous query.
